# ADR-0022: Signed portable evidence bundles

## Context

Hash chaining protects the local event log from accidental or casual edits,
but a reviewer or CI system needs a portable artifact whose contents and
provenance can be checked outside the originating workspace.

## Decision

`exportEvidenceBundle` packages a reconciled `COMPLETE` run, its projection,
event log, and referenced check outputs. Each file is hashed with SHA-256 and
the canonical bundle payload is signed with an Ed25519 private key. The key ID
and signature travel with the bundle; `verifyEvidenceBundle` independently
validates every file hash, the payload hash, and the signature. Callers can
additionally provide an explicit trust store to require an active key with the
expected identity instead of trusting the embedded public key.

The bundle contains check outputs as captured, so operators must treat it as a
potentially sensitive artifact and apply their existing retention controls.

## Consequences

Evidence can cross machine and CI boundaries without adding a remote service.
Key custody remains an operator responsibility; this is a signed artifact, not
a replacement for an enterprise KMS, certificate authority, or notarization
service. Trust-store entries support explicit rotation and revocation.
